                <p>Recently I did some work on seeing if I could get the very first iteration of Freefall running on my PC again. Thankfully, the class files were stored along with the rest of the code (because trying to compile from the source threw a bunch of errors -- apparently I had tried to refactor it at some point and never finished the job) but they didn't quite work right. Specifically, in my very early programming days I didn't take into account case sensitivity with file paths. In theory this isn't much of an issue (on Windows at least) but Java wasn't able to find some of the level and image files because of the path being lowercase when the files were in an uppercase directory. Not to worry, we just switched the case and everything ran! Well, not quite. Some images were being looked for in the "images" directory while some were being looked for in "Images". To add fun to it, Windows won't let you have "images" and "Images" next to each other because it considers them the same. I did find a workaround though and was able to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to copy "Images" to "images" and get it all up and running.</p>
